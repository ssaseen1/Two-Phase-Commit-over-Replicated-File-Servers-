Structure of code:

	- Client initiates a writeFile or readFile or deleteFile operation by invoking the respective method of the Coordinator. 
	
	- On invocation of its readFile or writeFile method, the Coordinator dislays the following menu:
		1. Send Vote Request
		2. Send Vote Request & Fail
		
	- For option 1, it asks for the votes of all the Participants and then continue with the 2 PC operation
	- For option 2, it sends a vote request to all the Participants and crashes.
	
	- On invocation of its readFile or writeFile method, the Participant dislays the following menu:
		1. Send Commit
		2. Send Abort
		3. Send Commit & Fail
	
	- For option 1, it will send a commit reply
	- For option 2, it will send an abort reply
	- For option 3, it will send a commit reply and crashes
	

RPC interface of Participant:

  TwoPhaseCommit deleteFile(1: string filename, 2: TwoPhaseCommit twoPhaseCommmit)
    throws (1: SystemException systemException)
  
  TwoPhaseCommit writeFile(1: RFile rFile, 2: TwoPhaseCommit twoPhaseCommmit)
    throws (1: SystemException systemException)
  
  RFile readFile(1: string filename)
    throws (1: SystemException systemException)
	
  string lastDecision(1: i32 transaction_id)
    throws (1: SystemException systemException)
	

Failure Detection:

Test Cases:

Coordinator	
	1. Send vote request
	2. Send vote request & Fail
	
Participant

	2. Send Abort
	3. Send Commit & Fail
	
- For consecutive delete on same  file, the second delete operation will abort
